# Kayak Automation Problem - SDET Assessment

Test automation program for the following actions:

Go to https://www.kayak.com.co/ 

1. Search for a trip:
  - From Medell√≠n to San Francisco 
  - Depart date March 10, 2021 
  - Return Date March 20, 2021
  - 2 Adults and 1 Child
2. After searching, update the departure date to April 10, 2021 and return date to April 20, 2021, and search again.
3. Select the option with the lowest price.
4. See the offer (it will redirect to a new page).
5. Validate that the offer is for the trip from Medellin to San Francisco.

# Assumptions

According to the original statement, the program should update the departure date to December 15, 2020 and the return date to January 5, 2021. But kayak.com.co does not allow you to look for dates that are less than the current date. Therefore, I used April 10, 2020 and April 20, 2020 instead.
